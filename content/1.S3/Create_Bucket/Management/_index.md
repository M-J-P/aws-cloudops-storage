### Exercise 1

# Creating a Simple Storage Solution Bucket
In this tutorial, you'll create an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Solution) bucket in a region of AWS.
We'll use the region named _us-east-1:_  for this exercise.  This region is located in Northern Virginia, and it was
the first AWS region to be constructed. 

As part of the creation of this S3 bucket, we'll review the different S3 storage classes. Further, we'll learn how to secure our bucket
through Access Control Lists (ACLs), Bucket Policies, and encryption.  Finally, we'll understand other configurable bucket options including:  life cycle policies, cross origin resource sourcing (CORS), and cross region replication (CRR).
