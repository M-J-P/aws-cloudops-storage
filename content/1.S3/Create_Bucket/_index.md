### Exercise 1

# Creating a Simple Storage Solution Bucket

In this tutorial, you'll create an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Solution) bucket in a region of AWS.
We'll use the region named `us-east-1`  for this exercise.  This region is located in Northern Virginia, and it was
the first AWS region to be constructed. 

As part of the creation of this S3 bucket, we'll cover some of the general properties. Further, we'll learn how to secure our bucket
through Access Control Lists (ACLs), Bucket Policies, and encryption.  Finally, we'll understand other configurable bucket options including:  life cycle policies, cross origin resource sourcing (CORS), and cross region replication (CRR).


#### STEPS:
1. Login to the AWS Console
2. Select the `us-east-1` region
3. Navigate to the S3 service
4. Select `General purpose buckets` from the left-hand menu
5. Select `Create Bucket`

#### Please move on to the next sections to continue.
